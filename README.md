# diceGameDuel


READ ME - (If you like to know what went wrong)

We've been asked to do a dice game.
The rules include at the code.

- After I had a html "skeleton", I added some css
So I can visually see its organs right before my eyes 
When I'm messing with them.
- I was approaching the JavaScript part by breaking the program to little pieces. Only than I started bite it.
- After writing the code, I improved the css.
In some point it worked as expected,
But in another, a later one, it ABSOLUTELY (no pun intended)
Went crazy, and everything that I noted to myself
During the styling path - as a lesson for the future -
Suddenly, didn't work.
- I've found myself sitting in the middle pf the night,
4 hours before I must wake up to another class lesson.
I gave up. 
I was bitten once again by technical issues which I wasn't
Brilliant (or at least experience) enough to fix.
I'm far from being the web developer that I wish I was in that point.
It's very disappointing, which is why I called this project: DICEappointment.


I'll get better. Hopefully soon enough.
